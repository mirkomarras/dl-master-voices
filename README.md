A Python toolbox for creating and testing impersonation capabilities of a potentially large family of adversarial audio
samples called **Master Voices** (MVs) which match large populations of speakers by chance with high probability. 

## Setup 

...

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Download Source Data Sets
[VoxCeleb1](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox1.html) contains over 100,000 utterances for 1,251 
celebrities, extracted from videos uploaded to YouTube. 

[VoxCeleb2](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html) contains over 1 million utterances for 6,112 
celebrities, extracted from videos uploaded to YouTube.

### Step 2: Train Speaker Verification Algorithms

#### XVector Model Training 

The training script looks for utterances in *data_source_vox1* and *data_source_vox2* folders, excluding the ones from users 
used for master voice analysis. Both data sources should point to a folder containing *dev* and *test* VoxCeleb folders. By 
default, the model is trained for *n_epochs=1024* on batches of size *batch_size=512* with a learning rate of 
*learning_rate=1e-1*. On each utterance, voice activity detection (*vad=[True|False]*) and data augmentation (*aug=[0:no|1:aug_any|2:aug_seq|3:aug_prob]*) can be performed. This step produces a x-vector model that is saved on the folder 
*model_dir*.

A sample x-vector training command is provided below: 

```
$ python ./train/train_x-vector_model.py 
  --data_source_vox1 "/beegfs/mm10572/voxceleb1" 
  --data_source_vox2 "/beegfs/mm10572/voxceleb2" 
  --noises_dir "./data/noise"
  --model_dir "./models/xvector/pre-trained"
  --aug 3 
  --vad True 
```

Please find the resulting pre-trained model in *./models/xvector/pre-trained*.
