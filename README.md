A Python toolbox for creating and testing impersonation capabilities of **Master Voices** (MVs), a family of adversarial 
audio samples which match large populations of speakers by chance with high probability. 

## Installation
Clone the repository:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/mirkomarras/dl-master-voices.git
cd ./dl-master-voices/
``` 

Create a Python environment:
``` 
module load python3/intel/3.6.3
python3 -m virtualenv mvenv
source mvenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

Copy the data folder:
``` 
unzip /archive/m/mm11333/data_original.zip
``` 

Create a folder for your sbatch jobs:
``` 
mkdir jobs
``` 

## Getting Started

### Running scripts in interactive mode

``` 
srun --time=168:00:00 --ntasks-per-node=1 --gres=gpu:1 --mem=8000 --pty /bin/bash
cd /path/to/dl-master-voices/
export PRJ_PATH="${PWD}"
export PYTHONPATH=$PRJ_PATH
source mvenv/bin/activate
module load ffmpeg/intel/3.2.2
module load cuda/10.0.130
module load cudnn/10.0v7.6.2.24

python type/your/script/here param1 param2
``` 

### Running scripts in sbatch mode

``` 
sbatch ./sbatch/train_verifier.sbatch
``` 

The sbatch folder contains a file for each routine. 

### Running Jupyter notebooks

Run the notebook on HPC:
``` 
sbatch ./notebooks/run_jupyterlab_cpu.sbatch
``` 

Open the file .slurm file automatically created in ./notebooks and look for a line similar to the following to get the PORT and the LINK:
``` 
...
```
 
Open a terminal locally in your laptop and run:
``` 
ssh -L PORT:localhost:PORT NYUID@prince.hpc.nyu.edu
``` 

Open your browser and paste the LINK retrieved above:
``` 
``` 

## Using

### Train a speaker verifier
``` 
python -u ./routines/verifier/train.py --net "xvector" --learning_rate 0.001 --aggregation 'gvlad' --batch 32 --decay_step 15
```

### Test a speaker verifier
``` 
python -u ./routines/verifier/test.py --net "xvector/v000" --aggregation 'gvlad' --test_n_pair 1000
```

### Train a GAN
``` 
...
``` 

### Test a GAN
``` 
...
``` 

### Optimize a MV
``` 
...
```

### Test a MV
```
