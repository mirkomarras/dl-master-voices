A Python toolbox for creating and testing impersonation capabilities of **Master Voices** (MVs), a family of adversarial 
audio samples which match large populations of speakers by chance with high probability.

## Usage (Command Line)

### Speaker Modelling

Speaker models aim to provide compact 1-D floating-point representations (i.e., embeddings) of vocal audio files, 
so that the embeddings extracted from vocal audio files of the same speaker are similar to each other (high
intra-class similarity) and those extracted from vocal audio files of different speakers are very dissimilar to
each other (low inter-class similarity). Depending on the architecture, a speaker model can take directly the raw
audio, the audio spectrogram, or the audio filterbank (see [here](https://haythamfayek.com/2016/04/21/speech-processing-for-machine-learning.html) 
for a more detailed discussion).  

With this repository, a range of pretrained models are available and can be downloaded from
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15_ElEam7brk6lPheVV0fVXDQ2i3W_Iw5?usp=sharing). Each model 
should be copied into the appropriate sub-folder in ```./data/vs_mv_models```. The best model performance 
on the trial verification pairs provided with the VoxCeleb1-Test dataset are reported below.

#### Train

``` 
python3 ./routines/verifier/train.py  --net "xvector" --val_n_pair 10000 
```

This script will save the model in ```./data/vs_mv_models/xvector/v000/model.h5```.  

#### Test
``` 
> python3 -u ./routines/verifier/test.py --net "xvector/v000"
```

This script will test the model on Vox1-Test and finally save a CSV file with a trial pair and a 
similarity score per row in ```./data/vs_mv_models/xvector/v000/test_vox1_sv_test.csv```.  

#### Pretrained Models


### Spectrogram Generation (GAN)

#### Train

```
> python3 routines/gan/train.py -d voxceleb-male -e 200
``` 

#### Test (show samples)
``` 
> python3 routines/gan/preview.py -d voxceleb-male
``` 

### Master Voice Optimization

#### Generation
...

#### Test

**Step 1.** Create a folder for your master voice set in ```./data/vs_mv_data```. For instance:

``` 
> mkdir -p ./data/vs_mv_data/real_f-f_sv/v000
``` 

**Step 2.** Copy the audio waveforms belonging to your master voice set in the new folder. 

**Step 3.** Run a routine to create a csv of trial pairs against a master voice.

``` 
> python3 routines/mv/create_pairs.py --mv_set "real_f-f_sv/v000" 
``` 

This script creates a folder ```./data/vs_mv_pairs/mv/real_f-f_sv/v000``` with trials pairs for 
all the audio waveforms in the target master voice set. Specifically, for each audio waveform, this
script creates a csv file into the above folder, including trials pairs for each user belonging to the
Vox2-Master-Voice-Analysis set (columns: label, path1, path2, gender).  

If ```--mv_set``` is not specified, this script creates a csv file for each set in ```./data/vs_mv_pairs/mv```.

**Step 4.** Create a noise folder
```
> mkdir ./data/vs_noise_data
```

**Step 5.** Run a routine to test all the master voice sets against the target verifier. 

``` 
> python3 routines/mv/test_pairs.py --net "xvector/v000" 
``` 

This script creates a folder ```./data/vs_mv_models/xvector/v000/mvcmp_any/```. For each csv file in
```./data/vs_mv_pairs/mv/```, this script computes the similarity scores returned by ```xvector/v000``` 
for each trial pair in the current csv. Finally, a copy of the csv file with an additional
column that includes the computed similarity scores is saved into the folder ```mvcmp_any``` (columns: 
score, label, path1, path2, gender). 

**Step 5.** Open the notebook ```./notebooks/speaker_verifier.ipynb``` to inspect speaker verifiers' performance in terms of Equal Error Rate and Impersonation Rate. This notebook will use all the csv files generated above.
