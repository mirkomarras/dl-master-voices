A Python toolbox for creating and testing impersonation capabilities of **Master Voices** (MVs), a family of adversarial 
audio samples which match large populations of speakers by chance with high probability. 

## Installation
Please go a to ```/beegfs/{id}``` directory, then:

``` 
git clone --single-branch --branch mv_fwk https://github.com/mirkomarras/dl-master-voices.git
cd dl-master-voices
chmod +x ./bash/install.sh
./bash/install.sh
``` 

This creates a virtual env ``` mvenv ```  in ```/beegfs/{id}``` folder, with all the needed Python packages.
It also downloads project data in ```/beegfs/{id}/dl-master-voices``` folder. 

## Getting Started
To start training a sample speaker verification model, from the project folder, please run:

``` 
screen -S mv_train
srun --time=120:00:00 --ntasks-per-node=1 --mem=64000 --gres=gpu:1 --pty /bin/bash
chmod +x ./bash/train.sh
./bash/train.sh
``` 

## Contribution
This code is provided for educational purposes and aims to facilitate reproduction of our results, and further research 
in this direction. We have done our best to document, refactor, and test the code before publication.

If you find any bugs or would like to contribute new models, training protocols, etc, please let us know.

Please feel free to file issues and pull requests on the repo and we will address them as we can.
