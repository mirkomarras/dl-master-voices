A Python toolbox for creating and testing impersonation capabilities of a potentially large family of adversarial audio
samples called **Master Voices** (MVs) which match large populations of speakers by chance with high probability. 

## Setup 

### Step 1: Install Python3
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.5
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
```
$ python3 -m virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Clone the Repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mirkomarras/dl-master-voices.git
$ export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/dl-master-voices/
```

### Step 4: Install Toolbox Requirements
```
$ pip install -r dl-master-voices/requirements.txt
```

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Download Source Data Sets
[VoxCeleb1](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox1.html) contains over 100,000 utterances for 1,251 
celebrities, extracted from videos uploaded to YouTube. 

[VoxCeleb2](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html) contains over 1 million utterances for 6,112 
celebrities, extracted from videos uploaded to YouTube.

### Step 2: Train and Evaluate a Speaker Verifier

The training script looks for utterances in *data_source_vox1* and *data_source_vox2* folders, excluding the utterances 
from users involved in master voice analysis. Both data sources must point to a folder including *dev* and *test* subfolders. 

The available verifiers are *xvector*, *vggvox*, *resnet34vox*, and *resnet50vox*. By default, xvector models
are trained on *300x24*-sized filterbanks and return vectors of size *1024*, while the other models are trained on 
*512x300x1*-sized spectrograms and return vectors of size *512*. Each model is trained for *n_epochs=40* on *batch_size=32* with *learning_rate=1e-1*.
The script saves the pre-trained model into the folder *model_dir*.

Voice detection (*vad=[True|False]*) and augmentation (*aug=[0:no|1:aug_any|2:aug_seq|3:aug_prob]*) can be performed. 

A sample training command is provided below: 

```
$ python ./train/train_speaker_verifier.py 
  --verifier "xvector"
  --data_source_vox1 "/beegfs/mm10572/voxceleb1" 
  --data_source_vox2 "/beegfs/mm10572/voxceleb2" 
  --noises_dir "./data/noise"
  --model_dir "./models/xvector/model"
  --aug 3 
  --vad True 
```

Please find the resulting pre-trained models in the table below.
 
| Name | Pre-Trained Model | Equal Error Rate  |

|  ResNet50Vox-Vector    |      [Link]()              |    |            

### Step 3: Train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

Please find the resulting pre-trained models in the table below.
 
| Name | Seed | Pre-Trained Model |

|  WaveGAN    |  F |     [Link]()             |        

### Step 4: Generate and Evaluate a Master Voice

Please find the resulting pre-trained models in the table below.
 
| Generator | Seed | Train | Master Voice Set | Any10 Impersonation Rate  | AVG10 Impersonation Rate  |
