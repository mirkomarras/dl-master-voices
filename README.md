A Python toolbox for creating and testing impersonation capabilities of a potentially large family of adversarial audio
samples called **Master Voices** (MVs) which match large populations of speakers by chance with high probability. 

## Setup 

...

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Download Source Data Sets
[VoxCeleb1](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox1.html) contains over 100,000 utterances for 1,251 
celebrities, extracted from videos uploaded to YouTube. 

[VoxCeleb2](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/voxceleb/vox2.html) contains over 1 million utterances for 6,112 
celebrities, extracted from videos uploaded to YouTube.

### Step 2: Train Speaker Verification Algorithms

The training script looks for utterances in *data_source_vox1* and *data_source_vox2* folders, excluding the ones from users 
used for master voice analysis. Both data sources should point to a folder containing *dev* and *test* VoxCeleb folders. The
available verifiers are the following ones: xvector, vggvox, resnet34vox, and resnet50vox. By 
default, the model is trained for *n_epochs=40* on *512x300*-sized spectrograms grouped in batches of size *batch_size=32* with a learning rate of 
*learning_rate=1e-1*. For each utterance, a resnet50-vector of size *512* is returned. On each utterance, voice activity detection (*vad=[True|False]*) and data augmentation (*aug=[0:no|1:aug_any|2:aug_seq|3:aug_prob]*) can be performed. This step saves a x-vector model on the folder 
*model_dir*.

A sample training command is provided below: 

```
$ python ./train/train_speaker_verifier.py 
  --verifier "xvector"
  --data_source_vox1 "/beegfs/mm10572/voxceleb1" 
  --data_source_vox2 "/beegfs/mm10572/voxceleb2" 
  --noises_dir "./data/noise"
  --model_dir "./models/pre-trained-resnet50vox"
  --aug 3 
  --vad True 
```

Please find the resulting pre-trained models trained on 1,024,292 utterances from 5,205 users in *./models/*.
