A Python toolbox for creating and testing impersonation capabilities of **Master Voices** (MVs), a family of adversarial 
audio samples which match large populations of speakers by chance with high probability. 

## Installation

Clone this repository:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/mirkomarras/dl-master-voices.git
cd ./dl-master-voices/
``` 

Create a Python environment:
``` 
module load python3/intel/3.6.3
python3 -m virtualenv mvenv
source mvenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

Copy the data folder:
``` 
unzip /archive/m/mm11333/data_20200706.zip
``` 

Create a folder for your sbatch jobs:
``` 
mkdir jobs
``` 

Add symlinks to voxceleb datasets:
``` 
ln -s /beegfs/mm11333/data/voxceleb1 ./data/
ln -s /beegfs/mm11333/data/voxceleb2 ./data/
``` 

## Getting Started

### Running scripts in interactive mode

``` 
srun --time=168:00:00 --ntasks-per-node=1 --gres=gpu:1 --mem=8000 --pty /bin/bash
export PRJ_PATH="${PWD}"
export PYTHONPATH=$PRJ_PATH
source mvenv/bin/activate
module load ffmpeg/intel/3.2.2
module load cuda/10.0.130
module load cudnn/10.0v7.6.2.24

python type/your/script/here param1 param2
``` 

### Running scripts in batch mode

Start the batch procedure:
``` 
sbatch ./sbatch/train_verifier.sbatch
``` 

Find the ```JOB ID```  of the sbatch procedure:
``` 
squeue -u $USER
``` 

Open the output file of the sbatch procedure:
``` 
cat ./jobs/slurm-<JOB ID>.out
``` 

### Running Jupyter notebooks

Run the notebook on HPC (please replace ```mm11333``` with your ```NYU ID``` at line 58 in ```run_jupyterlab_cpu.sbatch```):
``` 
cd ./notebooks/
sbatch ./run_jupyterlab_cpu.sbatch
``` 

Find the ```JOB ID``` of the notebook procedure:
``` 
squeue -u $USER
``` 

Open the output file of the sbatch procedure:
``` 
cat ./slurm-<JOB ID>.out
``` 

Find lines similar to the following ones and get the ```PORT``` (here 7500) and the Jupyter Notebook ```URL```:
``` 
 To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/mm11333/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-35214-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:7500/?token=8d70f37561638d78b1ad0096de2ffa4abab4862d336084ae
     or http://127.0.0.1:7500/?token=8d70f37561638d78b1ad0096de2ffa4abab4862d336084ae
```
 
Open a terminal locally in your laptop and run:
``` 
ssh -L <PORT>:localhost:<PORT> <NYU ID>prince.hpc.nyu.edu
``` 

Open your browser locally and paste the ```URL``` retrieved above, here:
``` 
http://localhost:7500/?token=8d70f37561638d78b1ad0096de2ffa4abab4862d336084ae
``` 

## Using

python -u ./routines/verifier/train.py --net "xvector" --learning_rate 0.001 --batch 32
```

### Test a speaker verifier
``` 
python -u ./routines/verifier/test.py --net "xvector/v000" --test_n_pair 1000
```

### Train a GAN
